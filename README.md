From "Beta" to "Release" I managed to get it from not being able to handle anything bigger then 27x27 to 90x90. Could go above 90x90 but max recursion depths gets reached when openening the map. The "Frames" have been fixed with it only updating the display when new information is needed. The way the numbers on each tile gets calculated has also been changed using the information from when a bomb is randomly placed instead of checking every tile; improving the load time immensly.
